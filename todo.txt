Shit that NEEDS to get done
	+ More sophisticated error recovery (i.e. not SEMICOLON synchset)

It can wait
	+ Fix outputting to error file appending rather than creating new file.
	+ Add functionality for output file (This can be done last)
	+ Strip file name from file path
	+ Update comments in all files
	+ Create makefile to compile and run tests instead of .sh file
	+ Remove needed -I for input files and assume last list of paths are input
	  files
	+ Update all phases' reports
